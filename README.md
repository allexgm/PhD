## Q-matrix calculation

- 'double-precission\_qmatrix.f90': main Fortran code for the Q-matrix calculation (double precission). It contains the auxiliary integrals computation and algorithms required to perform the calculations efficiently.
- *Not yet!* 'quad-precission\_qmatrix.f90': main Fortran code for the Q-matrix calculation (quad precission --> Dawson function is still being in double precission!). It contains the auxiliary integrals computation and algorithms required to perform the calculations efficiently.
- 'dawson-error-calculator.ipynb': Jupyter Notebook auxiliary script used to calculate the relative errors for different methods of computing the Dawson function.
